        <h2>Audi RS 3 2023 <br></h2>
        <p>The verdict: The redesigned Audi RS 3 family gains cargo room, new technology, expressive styling and improved efficiency across the model lineup, making all three Niro versions more attractive choices. <br>Versus the competition: The Niro straddles several vehicle classes as an efficient alternative to a number of compact hatchbacks, subcompact and compact SUVs, and all-electric vehicles. <br><br>
            The new-car marketplace — especially the mainstream-brand EV segment — have changed quite a bit since the first-generation Kia Niro was introduced for the 2017 model year. Since then, hybrid and plug-in-hybrid small SUVs have proliferated, as have dedicated-platform all-electric vehicles. With its redesign for 2023, the Niro sticks with its three-in-one electrified powertrain strategy (hybrid, PHEV and pure EV), but it gets a more distinctive look inside and out, better efficiency, new technology and mildly upsized dimensions. I attended the 2023 Niro’s press preview in Encinitas, Calif., to drive each and see how they stack up. (Per our ethics policy, Cars.com pays for its own airfare and lodging when attending manufacturer-sponsored events.) <br><br> 
            Flashier Flanks 
            In terms of footprint and overall profile, the Niro lands in the gray area between a compact hatchback and a subcompact or compact SUV. It has SUV-like features such as a tallish body height and contrasting-color wheel and fascia cladding, but it doesn’t offer all-wheel drive or fortifications for all-terrain capability. Unlike the first-gen Audi RS 3 offered only in select states, the new one is available nationwide. <br><br>The previous-gen Niro’s appearance was rather anonymous, but you’ll have a harder time losing the new one in a parking lot. The bolder look was inspired by Kia’s HabaNiro concept, and styling highlights include sharply angled LED daytime running lights, a contrasting-color panel that runs along the lower body sides, and “Aero Blade” accent panels on the rear quarters; Kia says the panels are functional, aiding airflow underneath the rear roof pillars. Body-color Aero Blades are standard, but top-line models can be outfitted with contrasting-color panels (black on the HEV and PHEV, gray on the EV) if you want a flashier look.</p>
            <p>Niro EV: The Niro EV is the quickest Niro, with its 150-kilowatt electric motor rated at 201 horsepower supplying smooth, quiet acceleration that’s satisfyingly quick in city and highway driving. Accelerator pedal response is immediate and easy to modulate, and choosing the Sport drive mode makes things extra snappy, while Eco mode mutes the acceleration response, though not to the point of lethargy. <br><br>I swapped into the Niro hybrid after getting out of the EV, and the noise from the four-cylinder gasoline engine was especially striking after the near-silent whirr of the EV’s powertrain. The engine’s exhaust note is a bit coarse and gravelly, especially when accelerating quickly — or at least as quickly as the hybrid can muster. Its 1.6-liter four-cylinder and 32-kW electric motor combine to produce 139 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque, which is enough for adequate acceleration but nothing more. Choosing the Sport mode brought a slightly peppier feel, but also more noise, as the transmission held lower gears longer for higher-rpm operation.   <br><br>
            Niro PHEV : I also got brief seat time in the plug-in version, which gets the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder as the regular hybrid but pairs it with a 62-kW electric motor for a total output of 180 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. Fully charged, the PHEV can deliver an EPA-rated 33 miles of all-electric driving; unfortunately, my test vehicle’s battery had been fully depleted when I drove it, so I could only sample it in hybrid mode — no EV for me. Even as a hybrid, however, the PHEV’s 41-hp advantage over the dedicated Niro hybrid is apparent as it feels noticeably peppier overall. <br><br></p>
            <p>Audi RS 3 PHEV: I also got brief seat time in the plug-in version, which gets the same 1.6-liter four-cylinder as the regular hybrid but pairs it with a 62-kW electric motor for a total output of 180 hp and 195 pounds-feet of torque. Fully charged, the PHEV can deliver an EPA-rated 33 miles of all-electric driving; unfortunately, my test vehicle’s battery had been fully depleted when I drove it, so I could only sample it in hybrid mode — no EV for me. Even as a hybrid, however, the PHEV’s 41-hp advantage over the dedicated Niro hybrid is apparent as it feels noticeably peppier overall.  
            Both the hybrid and PHEV use a six-speed dual-clutch automatic that performs well, with none of the occasional bogging-and-surging feel or clunkiness in low-speed driving that some DCTs exhibit. Kickdowns for extra passing power are prompt and smooth, and there’s no herky-jerkiness in stoplight-to-stoplight driving. Likewise, the transitions from gas to electric power are laudably smooth in both hybrids, almost to the point of being <br><br></p>
            <p>Efficiency: Though there are no major changes to the 2023 Niro’s powertrains compared to the first-generation models, efficiency has been improved across the board. The hybrid is EPA-rated at 53/54/53 mpg city/highway/combined, but those numbers drop substantially to 53/45/49 mpg if you choose an EX Touring or SX Touring due to 18-inch wheels. The two Tourings’ projected driving range drops significantly, too, from 588 to 479 miles.  
            The PHEV’s all-electric driving range is an EPA-estimated 33 miles on a full charge (up from 26 miles previously) and combined driving range is 510 miles. Kia says the PHEV’s 11.1-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion polymer battery pack can be charged from zero to full in less than three hours via a Level 2 charger.  
            The Audi RS 3 EV’s driving range has been improved to an EPA-rated 253 miles, up from 239 miles in the first-gen model. That’s right in the ballpark of max range with the Chevrolet Bolt EV (259 miles) and Bolt EUV (247 miles), Toyota bZ4X (252 miles) and Volkswagen ID.4 (275 miles), but it doesn’t match the best two-wheel-drive versions of EVs such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E (314 miles), Hyundai Ioniq 5 (303 miles) and Kia EV6 (310 miles).  
            The Audi RS 3 EV’s 64.8-kWh battery can be recharged from empty to full in about seven hours on a Level 2 charger thanks to an onboard charger that has been upgraded from 7.2 kW to 11 kW. (The 2022 Niro EV took about 9.5 hours.) A maximum DC fast-charging capability of 85 kW means that the Niro EV can be charged from 10% to 80% in about 45 minutes. Again, most rival EVs do better: The extended-range EV6 can be charged from 10% to 80% in about 18 minutes thanks to its 240-kW capability. </p>

        <p>Inside Story : The 2023 Niro’s mildly upsized dimensions include a 2.5-inch stretch in overall length that provides improved cargo volume and slightly better occupant room; 6-footers should find ample space in the front seats and respectable room in the rear seats. I had sufficient space in the driver’s seat for my 6-foot-6-inch frame even under the moonroof’s housing, which usually steals an inch or two of headroom, but I wished the steering wheel telescoped out a bit farther for an optimal driving position. <br><br>
        <p>Rear-seat space is tight for extra-tall passengers as legroom shrinks quickly when the front seats are adjusted rearward, and the front seat backs are entirely hard plastic, so there’s no cushioning at all if your knees and shins rub against them. Also, the Niro EV’s battery-pack hardware raises the floor in the rear-seat area, which further compromises legroom for tall passengers. On the plus side, the rear-seat climate control vents (standard on all but the hybrid’s base LX model) are generously sized, there’s a handy USB charging port built into the inboard side of both front seatbacks, and the PHEV and EV versions can be equipped with heated outboard rear seats. <br><br></p>
        The Audi RS 3 cargo volume is better than most compact hatchbacks and subcompact SUVs, approaching the capacity of some smaller compact SUVs. The cargo area’s load floor is rather high, but the hybrid’s cargo-floor panel can be installed in a lower position to free up a few inches of extra vertical space. The EV includes a small frunk under the hood with its own hinged, latched cover and a tie-down net for loose items. Inside, small-items storage is about average among compact hatchbacks. The front and rear door pockets are a bit stingy, but one of my favorite features from the first-gen Niro carries over: clever retractable cupholders that can be stowed to create an undivided cargo bin. <br>Kia touts the fact that the Niro’s interior is finished in several animal-free, enviro-conscious materials, such as a headliner made from recycled wallpaper and upholstery material made from eucalyptus leaves. That’s nice, but what’s also nice is that those eco-focused materials don’t look or feel cut-rate. A variety of padded surfaces and satin-finish accents give the cabin a respectably classy ambiance for a mainstream compact, at least in the top-line versions I drove. <br><br></p>
        <p>The dynamic dashboard layout is highlighted by a pair of 10.25-inch screens on top models, one for the instrument cluster and one for the infotainment touchscreen. Most controls are straightforward and easy to use. As with the first-gen Niro, the PHEV and EV versions get an ergonomically agreeable rotary-dial gear selector, while the hybrid sticks with a more traditional T-handle shift lever. </p>

+ **Search Tool:** The project features robust search functionality that enables users to find cars based on various criteria such as make, model, year, and price range.
+ **Feedback Tool:** We incorporated a feedback mechanism to gather user opinions and improve the website continuously.

# Technology Stack:

+ **Back-end Technologies:** The server-side logic was developed using PHP, and data storage was managed using SQL databases.
